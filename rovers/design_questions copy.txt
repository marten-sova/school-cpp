=== Design and Implementation Plan Questions ===

Below are a few questions about how you will design your program and your
implementation plan. It is crucial to have a reasonable design and
implementation plan before you start your program. Without this, success is
unlikely. The following questions will help guide you in your thinking and
raise some important questions and issues. There is no single "right" answer
to each of the questions but there are some "wrong" answers. Some designs and
plans are better than others. The point here is for you to think about what
you're going to do.

1) What classes to you intend to create? List each of the classes and provide
a brief description of the role of that class. This list is not set in
stone. As you implement your program, if you find that you need additional
classes that are not in this list, or that something you listed here doesn't
really fit, that's ok. The point is to start thinking about the high-level
structure of your program.
