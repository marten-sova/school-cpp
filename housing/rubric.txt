This is the grading rubric for the Housing programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - output for familydata.txt matches expected.txt 100% (including all
 whitespace)
 - the program runs on familydata.txt in less than 2 seconds

Implementation	    10
 - the hash table uses a linkedlist to handle collisions
 - Horner's rule is used to implement the hashing function 
 - has a copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor for all classes
   that have pointer data members.
 - no memory leaks or memory errors
 - the hashtable uses a dynamically allocated array for storage
 - housinghelper.cpp is unchanged

Design		     3
 - uses at least the following classes: family, hashtable, and familymgr
 - the familymgr class doesn't contain any implementation of the hashtable
 - the hashtable class doesn't do any output except for dumpTable()

Style		     2
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
