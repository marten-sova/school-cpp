This is the grading rubric for the Experiments programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - the output of your program matches expected.txt 100% (including all
 whitespace)
 - the program runs, using the unmodified experiments.cpp, in less than 1 second

Implementation	    10
 - the data is stored in a binary tree as per the instructions
 - all string data is represented with a char* type variable (not std::string)
 - methods that display the tree must be recursive
 - has a copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor for all classes
   that have pointer data members.
 - no memory leaks or memory errors
 - experiments.cpp is unchanged

Design		     3
 - uses at least the following classes: plant, planttree, and treenode
 - the plant class does not contain any pointers to other plants
 - the treenode class/struct should not contain any parent pointers

Style		     2
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
