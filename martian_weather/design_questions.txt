1) What classes to you intend to create? List each of the classes and provide
a brief description of the role of that class. This list is not set in
stone. As you implement your program, if you find that you need additional
classes that are not in this list, or that something you listed here doesn't
really fit, that's ok. The point is to start thinking about the high-level
structure of your program.

dataLogger
linkedList
weatherData
statistics - regarding the data analysis, finding most common values etc

2) Which class do you plan to implement first? Why?

weatherData, since the other classes will deal with it directly or indirectly.

3) What is your algorithm for finding the most common temperature and
windspeed values?

Since we would have the linked list sorted by both of those variables, could simply iterate through the list tracking the highest count of consecutive common values.

4) One approach to finding all of the values less than -50C is to check each
value as it is being inserted into the list. If the new value is less than
-50C then increment a counter. This approach will not work for this
program. Why not? 

I believe this refers to this line in instructions.txt: "For example, the datalogger shouldn't have access to "nodes" in the linked list"

5) What is your testing strategy? Will you only use the given data file or
will you create smaller data files to help focus your testing?

I will mainly use a much smaller test data file for testing and debugging early on. Once everything is somewhat functional I will test with the full data set too.

6) What is your strategy for finding and addressing memory leaks? Will you get
the whole program working first and then address memory leaks or will you
check on memory leaks as you go?

I intend to get the main structure of the program set up and working, then check the performance periodically.
