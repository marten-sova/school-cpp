This is the grading rubric for the Martian Weather programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - output for climatedata.txt matches expected.txt 100% (including all
 whitespace)
 - the program runs on climagedata.txt in less than 5 seconds

Implementation	    10
 - uses a triply-threaded linked list to store the data
 - sorts the data as it is being inserted
 - has a copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor for all classes
   that have pointer data members.
 - no memory leaks
 - no memory errors
 - weatherlog.cpp is unchanged

Design		     3
 - uses at least the following classes: datalogger, linkedlist, and
 weatherdata
 - the datalogger class doesn't contain any linked-list behavior
 - the linked list class doesn't do any output (except for optional debugging)

Style		     2
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
